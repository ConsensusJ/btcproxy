NOTE: The standard ports for **RPC** and **P2P** are the defaults in Bitcoin Core. The standard ports for **ZMQ** are recommended by this project (and somewhat influenced by the Lightning Network Daemon installation instructions)

By using standard ports we achieve the following goals:

1. We can run MainNet, TestNet, and RegTest simultaneously on the same host.
2. We minimize the amount of reconfiguration of different tools, etc.
